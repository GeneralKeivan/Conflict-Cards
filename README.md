# Conflict Cards
This game has been created for the thesis project of Keivan Banan studying Computer Engineering at the Shahid Beheshti University.
To play the game, you just need the Game Folder located in the repository.
If you want to see the game in the unity game engine, you need the whole repo.
The first time you run it on unity it might take a while because it needs to create the library folder from scratch.
